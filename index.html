          You’ve turned 21!! And I’m writing a letter for you, lucky you! Guess
          your charm had worked. You’ve seemed to have cracked the toughest
          mission on earth, jk :P, making me do cute stuff for you on your Bday.
          But you deserve all of it. My writing skills aren’t great, and you’ll
          realise that soon.<br />
          <br />
          I love how we are sharing more honest and real versions of ourselves,
          which makes this not so perfect but very real. I feel good about this.
          Happy Birthday haan. It's supposed to be happy, so just stop feeling
          low and cheer up. I’m trying my best to make it so. Imagine krlo i’m
          gonna be there, waiting under your balcony, and then we drive all the
          way to ur fav place. Just a matter of time and I’ll make this real !
          Because you are just amazing! <br /></br>
          I did try to get a gift for you, spent a lot of time, yet couldn’t
          find something cute enough. If I were at home with you, I could’ve
          made your special day more special, nvm , next time i’ll surely clear
          all your complaints. <br /><br />
          It’s your birthday, has to be special, does that
          mean i’ll hype you up with lots of tareef? Maybe. Coz you are super
          cute, adorable, hot and naughty at times! I might not always say, but
          our bond has always deepened no matter how many issues we had, it
          hasn't affected our friendship! <br /><br />
          It's been more than two years of
          knowing you and goddamn the Growth; it's beautiful ! Here’s to so many
          more years to come! Much love! I hope this made your day a bit better.
          I feel so lucky to have such an amazing person in my life. Thanks for
          making my life better !  <br /><br />
